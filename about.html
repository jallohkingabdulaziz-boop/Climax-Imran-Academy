    <!-- Intro -->
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Climax Imran Academy was established in 2014 with a vision to provide
      quality education and moral guidance to students in Rokel and beyond.
      Our school is committed to nurturing the intellectual, social, and
      emotional growth of every learner.
    </p>

    <!-- History -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Climax Imran Academy was born from a dream and a strong family vision for quality education in Rokel.</p>
      <p>The idea first came to life in 2014 when founder <strong>Mr. Imran Kamara</strong> considered establishing the school at Deep Eye Water. After family discussions, the school began at their own premises in Rokel. With the support of their father, the dream started to take shape.</p>
      <p>Initially, four classrooms were built with mat-thatch roofing, later upgraded. The school opened in 2016/2017 with Nursery and Primary classes. A milestone came in 2021, when the school received its WAEC examination code for BECE and WASSCE. Since then, our students have excelled in public examinations.</p>
      <p>Today, the academy owns a permanent site at Upper Railway Line, Rokel, with plans for modern facilities, a library, science labs, and a recreational centre.</p>
